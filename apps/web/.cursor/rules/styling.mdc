## 🎨 Design Philosophy

- The visual style follows **Neo-Brutalism** — bold, geometric, functional, and expressive.
  - Embrace solid color blocks, thick outlines, minimal gradients.
  - Avoid photorealism or excessive skeuomorphism.
  - Use deliberate spacing, flat shadows, strong hierarchy, and subtle motion.
- The tone is **playful yet minimal**, balancing a sense of handcrafted imperfection with crisp readability.
- The focus is on **clarity**, **speed**, and **player presence** rather than heavy animation.
- We are using Tailwind v4. We prefer the v4 way of doing things when it comes to Tailwind.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

- The visual style follows **Neo-Brutalism** — bold, geometric, functional, and expressive.
  - Embrace solid color blocks, thick outlines, minimal gradients.
  - Avoid photorealism or excessive skeuomorphism.
  - Use deliberate spacing, flat shadows, strong hierarchy, and subtle motion.
- The tone is **playful yet minimal**, balancing a sense of handcrafted imperfection with crisp readability.
- The focus is on **clarity**, **speed**, and **player presence** rather than heavy animation.
- We are using Tailwind v4. We prefer the v4 way of doing things when it comes to Tailwind.

## Working with colors

- Let's try to use colors defined globals.css so that we manage light / dark variations through these variables and not by means of tailwinds' "dark:" directive.
- If a new color needs to be introduced and looks like something we'll be using in other components, then define the color in globals.css with a proper variable including it's corresponding dark variation.
- In specific cases (one-offs), it's fine to avoid abstraction by just using tailwind colors and "dark:" directive

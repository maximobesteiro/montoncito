## 🔌 Technical Architecture (Frontend)

- Built with **Next.js (React)**, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS v4.
- **Server Components** for static/lobby pages; **Client Components** for live game view.
- **Zustand** to manage transient UI state.
- Real-time updates are powered by **Socket.IO**. Connection logic is managed by a module-level singleton, while components interact via a custom React hook.
- Shared **core-game** logic imported from local package for deterministic replay and validation.
